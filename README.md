## Expected benefit to the developer community
This application has been built on Foundry, with the objective of providing real-world use to others by being not only helpful, but also deployable out of the box and (since this is published in bootstrap mode) highly customiseable. It is public with an APACHE 2.0 open source license to enable open use and sourcing, in line with the terms of entering the Dev

The tooling used could be modified to suit other potential use cases, for example:
- adapted to work as an in-house (at a large corporation) project watcher to automatically suggest intra-company opportunities
- work on a different use case than helping businesses work together, for instance instead helping alike NGOs, charities and volunteers unite to tackle big problems
- analysing how similar or different similarly performing businesses are
Hence, there are numerous benefits to the open sourcing of this project and if you have any ideas, I would love to discuss them with you!

## Setup
0. Download the zip file into your instance of Foundry by uploading the zip file into your marketplace and then installing it from that same marketplace.
1. Verify that the sample data has integrated into pipelines correctly and that 
2. Fix any incompatible user permissions in Ontology actions
3. Host the application as a web app via Palantir Foundry
